# India-Visa-Online

Applying for a visa for India can be very cumbersome and time-consuming. Here is a short summary of the problems I have encountered and their solutions.

# The website

The official website is https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/ . 
 As you will see, it looks quite outdated and if you dare to take a look at the HTML or Javascript code, don't be shocked, but be happy that the page is still running.

# Preparation
## Browser

The website recommends Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer 9 and above. I had the best experience with a recent Firefox. It can save you from hours of useless typingh if you install a browser login which remembers your form input. For Firefox I used _Form History Control_ from https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/form-history-control/ .

## Mail/DNS

In the case you use your own DNS resolver and mail server, make sure your resolver has no problems with DNSSEC validation fails or add `nic.in` to the mailservers whitelist for nun-eistent domains.

## Passport photo

You need a scan of a passport photo with light background (not just taken from the passwort). The European standard portrait format 35mm Ã— 45mm is too tall, it must be possible to crop it so that it is almost square. Only JPEG files are accepted.
