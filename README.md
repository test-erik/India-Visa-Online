# India-Visa-Online

Applying for a visa for India can be very cumbersome and time-consuming. Here is a short summary of the problems I have encountered and their solutions.

# The website

The official website is https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/ . 
 As you will see, it looks quite outdated and if you dare to take a look at the HTML or Javascript code, don't be shocked, but be happy that the page is still running.

# Preparation
## Browser

The website recommends Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer 9 and above. I had the best experience with a recent Firefox. It can save you from hours of useless typingh if you install a browser login which remembers your form input. For Firefox I used _Form History Control_ from https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/form-history-control/ .
